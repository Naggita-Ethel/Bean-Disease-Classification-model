# Bean-Disease-Classification-model
Machine learning model to classify healthy, bean rust diseased and angular leaf spot diseased images of bean plants using five classification algorithms. These algorithms are decision trees, lgistic regeression, random forest, simple CNN and ResNet Neural Network. The dataset contained 5284 healthy images, 2510 bean rust diseased images, 2549 angular leaf spot diseased images and was obtained from Makerere University AI Lab website. The ResNet model portrayed the best performance. Techniques like regularization and early stopping were employed for better algorithm performance. Image preprocessing was done and evaluation metrics like the confusion matrix and classification reports were used.
